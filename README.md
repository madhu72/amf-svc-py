# amf-svc-py

Service management is part of an overall application framework Agile Message Framework (AMF) and this code base is a subset of a larger infrastructure that is made available as OpenSource under MIT License.  

This has been envisioned to be a generic start, stop, restart processs with pluggable modules for each system or sub-system in any environment.   This was created in the context of Managed File Transfer during our experience with IBM customers using Sterling File Gategway and Axway customers, but could be used for any platform by creating new modules.

# Install

* Clone  or download this repository to a directory of your choice.
* Create a symbolic link for amf.py -> ln -s amf.py amf
* Create an environment variable per module. For example, for the module amf_svc_sfg.py, create an Environment variable called AMF_SFG_HOME, which is the base path of Sterling File Gateway (SFG).
* For GM module amf_svc_gm.py, create an Environment variable called AMF_GM_HOME, which is the base path of GM Pre-requisites (Cassandra, Zookeeper, etc)
* Either create an alias for amf or put the path of amf.py in PATH
* If a particular node is an External Purge node, just add an Environment variable called SFG_EXTERNAL_PURGE=true and external purge will automatically be managed for that node in the cluster.
* For primary token nodes of Cassandra that have reaper, and the zookeeper nodes, use these environment variables to report the availability:
** USE_REAPER=true
** USE_ZOOKEEPER=true
